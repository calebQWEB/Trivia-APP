# Trivia-APP
This is a question and answer app, that gets data from a trivia [API](https://the-trivia-api.com/)


## Tools used
- Html
- CSS 
- JavaScript

## Process
- ![Categories section](/images/Trivia.png)

The categories in the section you see above are samples of the some of the categories in the API, and it is hard coded. I added an event listener in javaScript to listen for a click, and when one of the category is clicked it gets the innerText and stores it in a variable, we now use that variable to fetch the data containing the category the user clicked.

- Same as the difficulty section

- when the user is done answering all the 10 possible questions, the app shows a page containing the users result

- I also added a bit of animation on the starting page using Gsap
